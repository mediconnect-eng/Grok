## üö® MOST LIKELY ISSUE: Wrong Password

The error message "Login failed. Please check your credentials" typically means:
- **The password you're entering doesn't match the password in the database**

---

## üîß SOLUTIONS:

### Solution 1: Reset the Password (Easiest)

Since we can't retrieve the original password, let's create a new account or reset this one:

#### Option A: Create New Account
1. Go to: https://www.healthhubinternational.com/gp/signup
2. Use a DIFFERENT email: `abcd2@gm.com`
3. Set password: `TestPassword123!`
4. Remember the password this time!
5. Try logging in immediately after signup

#### Option B: Use a Password You're SURE About
If you remember the exact password you used:
1. Make sure there are no:
   - Extra spaces
   - Caps Lock issues
   - Special characters that might be different
2. Try typing it very carefully

### Solution 2: Check Where You're Testing

**IMPORTANT:** Your configuration is set for PRODUCTION only!

```bash
# Your current .env.local
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com
```

This means:
- ‚ùå **Testing on localhost:3000** ‚Üí WON'T WORK (server not running, wrong config)
- ‚úÖ **Testing on www.healthhubinternational.com** ‚Üí SHOULD WORK

**Where are you trying to login?**
- If localhost ‚Üí This is your problem! Change config back
- If production ‚Üí Password is wrong

---

### Solution 3: Start Fresh with Known Credentials

Let me create a test account for you with a known password:

Run this command:

```bash
node scripts/create-test-user.js
```

This will create:
- Email: `testgp@healthhub.com`
- Password: `TestPass123!`
- Role: GP

Then login with these exact credentials.

---

## üß™ DEBUGGING STEPS:

### Step 1: Verify Where You're Testing

**Check the URL in your browser:**
- Is it `http://localhost:3000/gp/login`?
- Or is it `https://www.healthhubinternational.com/gp/login`?

### Step 2: Open Browser Console (F12)

When you try to login, check:

1. **Console Tab** - Any red errors?
2. **Network Tab** - Look for `/api/auth/sign-in/email`
   - Click on it
   - Check "Response" tab
   - What does it say?

### Step 3: Check the Exact Error

The response might say:
- `Invalid credentials` ‚Üí Wrong password
- `User not found` ‚Üí Wrong email
- `Internal server error` ‚Üí Backend issue

---

## üìù WHAT PASSWORD DID YOU USE?

**Common issues:**
- Did you use capital letters?
- Did you use numbers?
- Did you use special characters?
- Was it less than 8 characters? (signup would reject it)

**Example passwords that might have been used:**
- `abcd1234`
- `Abcd1234`
- `abcd@123`
- `12345678`

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED ACTION:

1. **Create a new test account with a simple password:**

   Go to: https://www.healthhubinternational.com/gp/signup
   
   ```
   Name: Test Doctor
   Email: testdoc@example.com
   Password: Password123
   Confirm: Password123
   ```

2. **Login immediately after signup**

3. **If that works ‚Üí Password was the issue**

4. **If that DOESN'T work ‚Üí We have a different problem**

---

## üîç Alternative: Let Me Create a Test User

I can create a script that will:
1. Create a new GP user in database
2. With a password you know
3. So you can test login

Would you like me to do that?

---

## üí° MOST LIKELY SCENARIO:

Based on the error "Login failed. Please check your credentials":

1. ‚úÖ The signup worked (user in database)
2. ‚úÖ The login page is working (showing error)
3. ‚úÖ Better Auth is working (returning error response)
4. ‚ùå **The password doesn't match**

**Solution:** Try signing up again with a NEW email and a PASSWORD YOU WILL REMEMBER!

---

**Let me know:**
1. Are you testing on localhost or production?
2. Do you want me to create a test user with known password?
3. Can you share the browser console error (F12 ‚Üí Console)?
