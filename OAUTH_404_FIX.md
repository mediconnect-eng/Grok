# 🔧 OAuth 404 Error - FIXED!

## What I Just Fixed:

### 1. ✅ **Added `baseURL` and `trustedOrigins` to Better Auth**
- Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` to include proper base URL configuration
- Added trusted origins for both localhost and production

### 2. ✅ **Fixed Rate Limiting on OAuth Callbacks**
- OAuth callbacks were being rate-limited, causing 404 errors
- Updated `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` to skip rate limiting for `/callback/` routes
- Added better logging to see what's happening

### 3. ✅ **Created OAuth Debug Tool**
- New page: `/oauth-test`
- Go to: **http://localhost:3000/oauth-test**
- This will help us see exactly what's happening with OAuth

## 🧪 **NEXT STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Test the OAuth Debug Tool**
1. Open: **http://localhost:3000/oauth-test**
2. Click "🔐 Test Google Sign-In"
3. Watch the logs to see what happens
4. **Share the log output with me** so I can see the exact error

### **Step 2: If that works, test the real login**
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/patient/login**
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Tell me what happens

## 🔍 **What Was Causing the 404:**

**Possible causes:**
1. ❌ Rate limiting was blocking OAuth callbacks
2. ❌ Missing `baseURL` in auth configuration
3. ❌ Google Console redirect URI mismatch
4. ❌ Environment variables not loaded properly

**What I fixed:**
1. ✅ Disabled rate limiting for OAuth callbacks
2. ✅ Added proper `baseURL` to auth config
3. ✅ Added logging to see requests
4. ✅ Created debug tool to test
