### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Test It**

After 5 minutes, go to:
```
https://www.healthhubinternational.com/patient/login
```

Click **"Continue with Google"** and it should work! ‚úÖ

## üö® **Why It Broke:**

Your Google OAuth was ONLY configured for `localhost:3000`, so when users visit `www.healthhubinternational.com`, Google rejects the login because the domain doesn't match.

By adding your production domain to Google Cloud Console, you're telling Google: "Yes, this domain is allowed to use OAuth."

---

## ‚úÖ **After This Works:**

Both will work:
- ‚úÖ Local development: `http://localhost:3000` 
- ‚úÖ Production: `https://www.healthhubinternational.com`
