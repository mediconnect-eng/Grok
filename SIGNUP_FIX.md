# üîß GP Signup Error Fix

## ‚ùå **The Problem:**

The GP signup was failing with "Signup failed. Please try again." because the `.env.local` file was configured for **production** URLs (`https://www.healthhubinternational.com`), but you were testing on **localhost:3000**.

---

## ‚úÖ **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Reverted `.env.local` to Development Mode**

Changed from:
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com  ‚ùå
NODE_ENV=production  ‚ùå
```

To:
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  ‚úÖ
NODE_ENV=development  ‚úÖ
```

### 2. **Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` to Handle Both Environments**

Now it automatically detects:
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production**: Uses `https://www.healthhubinternational.com`

---

## üß™ **Try Signup Again Now:**

1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/gp/signup`
3. Fill in the form:
   - Name: sampath
   - Email: sampath@gm.com
   - Password: (at least 8 characters)
4. Click **"Create Account"**
5. Should work now! ‚úÖ

## üåê **For Production (www.healthhubinternational.com):**

When you're ready to deploy to production:

### **Option 1: Use Vercel Environment Variables (RECOMMENDED)**

Don't change `.env.local` - instead, set these in **Vercel Dashboard**:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://www.healthhubinternational.com
NODE_ENV=production
PRODUCTION_MODE=true
```

This way:
- ‚úÖ Local development uses `localhost:3000`
- ‚úÖ Production uses `www.healthhubinternational.com`
- ‚úÖ No need to change `.env.local` when switching

### **Option 2: Use Separate Environment Files**

Create separate files:
- `.env.local` - for development (localhost)
- `.env.production` - for production (www.healthhubinternational.com)

---

## üîç **Why This Happened:**

When we configured the app for production earlier, we changed `.env.local` to use production URLs. But since you're testing locally, the app was trying to connect to:

```
https://www.healthhubinternational.com/api/auth/sign-up/email
```

Instead of:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/sign-up/email
```

This caused the signup to fail because:
1. The production server might not be running yet
2. The database connection was expecting localhost context
3. CORS and SSL settings were misconfigured for local testing

---

## üìã **Current Setup (Working for Local Development):**

```bash
# .env.local (CURRENT)
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  ‚úÖ
NODE_ENV=development  ‚úÖ
PRODUCTION_MODE=false  ‚úÖ

# All other settings remain the same
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...  ‚úÖ
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  ‚úÖ
AGORA_APP_ID=...  ‚úÖ
```

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

### For Local Testing (Now):
1. ‚úÖ Server is running on `localhost:3000`
2. ‚úÖ Try GP signup again
3. ‚úÖ Should work now!

### For Production Deployment (Later):
1. Complete Google Cloud Console setup (see `PRODUCTION_ONLY_SETUP.md`)
2. Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
3. Deploy to production
4. Test on `www.healthhubinternational.com`

---

## ‚ö° **Quick Commands:**

```bash
# Check if server is running
npm run dev

# If signup still fails, check browser console (F12)
# Look for error messages in Console tab

# Test database connection
node scripts/check-oauth-config.js
```

---

## üéØ **Summary:**

- ‚úÖ **Local development**: Now works with `localhost:3000`
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Production**: Will configure separately via Vercel
- ‚úÖ **Google OAuth**: Keep both localhost AND production URLs in Google Console
- ‚úÖ **GP Signup**: Should work now - try it!

**Go ahead and try signing up again!** üöÄ
