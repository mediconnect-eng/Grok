## ✅ ROLE ASSIGNMENT FIX - COMPLETE

### 🎯 Problem You Identified

**"Whenever I'm signing up using any signup page, it is registering me as a patient and not as a GP."**

**You were 100% correct!** All signups were creating "patient" users regardless of which portal.

---

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

#### Files Changed:

1. **NEW API Endpoint:** `src/app/api/auth/signup-with-role/route.ts`
   - Custom signup that saves role to database
   
2. **Updated Signup Pages:**
   - `src/app/gp/signup/page.tsx` → Now sets role='gp'
   - `src/app/patient/signup/page.tsx` → Now sets role='patient'
   - `src/app/specialist/signup/page.tsx` → Now sets role='specialist'
   - `src/app/pharmacy/signup/page.tsx` → Now sets role='pharmacy'
   - `src/app/diagnostics/signup/page.tsx` → Now sets role='diagnostics'

### 🧪 How To Test

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (push changes)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Set proper user roles during signup"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test GP Signup:**
   - Go to: `https://www.healthhubinternational.com/gp/signup`
   - Sign up with new email: `testgp456@test.com`
   - Login at: `/gp/login`
   - ✅ Should work!

3. **Verify in Database:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-user-issues.js
   ```
   - Check that new user has role='gp'

### 📊 Before vs After

**BEFORE:**
```
GP Signup → User created with role=NULL or 'patient' ❌
Login to /gp/login → FAILS (wrong role) ❌
```

**AFTER:**
```
GP Signup → User created with role='gp' ✅
Login to /gp/login → SUCCESS ✅
```

### 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

All code changes are complete and ready to push to production.

**Next Steps:**
1. Push to GitHub
2. Wait for Vercel deploy (~2 min)
