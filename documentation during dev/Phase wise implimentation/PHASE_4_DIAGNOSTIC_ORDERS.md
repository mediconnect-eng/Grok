## Completion Date
October 14, 2025

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**Already existed from migration 003:**
- `diagnostic_orders` table with columns:
  - `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `diagnostic_center_id`, `consultation_id`
  - `test_types` (TEXT[]) - Array of test names
  - `special_instructions`, `urgency`
  - `status` - pending | scheduled | sample_collected | in_progress | completed | cancelled
  - `scheduled_date`, `scheduled_time`
  - `results_url`, `results_notes`
  - `order_fee`, `payment_status`
  - Timestamps: `created_at`, `scheduled_at`, `completed_at`, `updated_at`
- Indexes on: `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `diagnostic_center_id`, `status`

### 2. API Endpoints ‚úÖ

#### **POST /api/diagnostic-orders/create**
**Purpose:** GP creates diagnostic order for patient

**Parameters:**
- `patientId` - Patient ID
- `doctorId` - GP creating the order
- `consultationId` - Optional source consultation
- `testTypes` - Array of test names (required)
- `specialInstructions` - Optional instructions
- `urgency` - routine | urgent | emergency
- `diagnosticCenterId` - Optional specific diagnostic center

**Available Test Types (18 total):**
- Lab Tests: CBC, Blood Glucose, Lipid Profile, LFT, KFT, TFT, Urinalysis, HbA1c, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12
- Imaging: Chest X-Ray, ECG, Ultrasound, MRI Scan, CT Scan, Echocardiogram, Mammogram, Bone Density Scan

**Flow:**
1. Validates consultation if provided
2. Creates diagnostic order (status: 'pending')
3. Notifies patient about tests ordered
4. If specific center assigned ‚Üí notifies that center
5. If no center ‚Üí notifies ALL diagnostic centers
6. Returns order details

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "order_123...",
    "test_types": ["Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Blood Glucose"],
    "status": "pending",
    "urgency": "routine",
    "patientName": "John Doe",
    "doctorName": "Dr. Smith"
  }
}
```

**Also provides GET endpoint** to fetch available test types list.

---

#### **POST /api/diagnostic-orders/[id]/update-status**
**Purpose:** Diagnostic center updates order status and uploads results

**Parameters:**
- `status` - New status (pending/scheduled/sample_collected/in_progress/completed/cancelled)
- `diagnosticCenterId` - Center performing the update
- `scheduledDate` - When scheduled (for 'scheduled' status)
- `scheduledTime` - Time slot (for 'scheduled' status)
- `resultsUrl` - Link to results (for 'completed' status)
- `resultsNotes` - Additional notes (for 'completed' status)

**Status Workflow:**
1. **pending** ‚Üí Order created, waiting for center to schedule
2. **scheduled** ‚Üí Center schedules appointment with date/time
3. **sample_collected** ‚Üí Patient visited, samples collected
4. **in_progress** ‚Üí Tests being processed
5. **completed** ‚Üí Results ready, uploaded
6. **cancelled** ‚Üí Order cancelled

**Notifications Sent:**
- **Scheduled**: Patient + Doctor notified with date/time
- **Sample Collected**: Patient + Doctor notified
- **In Progress**: Patient + Doctor notified
- **Completed**: Patient + Doctor notified with results link
- **Cancelled**: Patient + Doctor notified

**Auto-assigns diagnostic center** if not already assigned when status is first updated.

## üîÑ Diagnostic Orders Workflow

### Complete Flow Example:

1. **GP Orders Tests**
   - GP views patient consultation
   - Clicks "Order Diagnostic Tests"
   - Selects: CBC, Blood Glucose, Lipid Profile
   - Sets urgency: Routine
   - Adds instructions: "Patient should fast for 12 hours"
   - Submits

2. **System Processing**
   - Creates order (status: pending)
   - Finds all diagnostic centers
   - Notifies patient: "Dr. Smith has ordered diagnostic tests for you: CBC, Blood Glucose, Lipid Profile"
   - Notifies all diagnostic centers

3. **Patient Notified**
   - Receives notification
   - Link to /patient/diagnostics/orders
   - Can view order details and instructions

4. **Diagnostic Center Claims & Schedules**
