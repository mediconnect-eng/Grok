**Ready to proceed?**

Reply with:
- **"Build it"** - I'll start implementing immediately
- **"Build Phase 1 only"** - Just patient registration first
- **"Show me the code first"** - I'll create code samples
- **"Let me do it"** - I'll provide guidance as you build

**This will transform your app from demo ‚Üí real healthcare platform.** üè•
